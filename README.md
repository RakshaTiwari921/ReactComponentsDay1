# ReactComponentsDay1
React Components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow you to break the UI into independent, reusable pieces and think about each piece in isolation.

Key Characteristics of React Components:
Reusable: Components can be used multiple times throughout the application.
Independent: Each component manages its own state and logic.
Composable: Components can be combined to build complex UIs.
Modular: Breaking the UI into smaller components makes the code easier to manage and understand.
Declarative: Components describe what the UI should look like rather than how to construct it.
